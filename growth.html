            <h3>Reflection on Chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars"</h3>
            <p>
                In chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars," Jim Rohn and Chris Widener highlight essential life lessons. 
                Chapter 4 discusses the importance of setting goals and developing meaningful relationships, 
                while also being patient and persistent in achieving ambitions. Chapter 5 emphasizes living life without regrets, 
                encouraging action over hesitation. Chapter 6 focuses on surrounding yourself with like-minded people who push you to be your best,
                ensuring you aren't merely a spectator in life. Finally, chapter 7 stresses the value of continuous learning, self-education, 
                and staying open to new possibilities to avoid stagnation.<br>
                These lessons inspire me to cultivate better relationships and remain dedicated to my personal and professional growth. 
                While I havenâ€™t yet acquired specific skills in my Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking program, 
                I plan to apply these principles by setting clear goals, 
                maintaining focus, and surrounding myself with positive influences to succeed in my journey.
