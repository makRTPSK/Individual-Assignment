            <h3>My Strongest Trait: Determination and Resilience</h3>
            <p>Determination and resilience are key traits that define my approach to academic challenges. 
                Whenever I'm faced with a difficult project or a tight deadline, my resilience helps me keep pushing forward, 
                while my determination ensures that I never give up. These traits were evident during a recent group project, 
                where my perseverance was crucial in meeting a tight deadline and producing high-quality work.</p>    
        </section>

        <section class="hobby">
            <h3>My Hobby</h3> 
            <p>My main hobbies are playing basketball and creating music. 
                Playing basketball teaches me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance, 
                while my passion for creating music, especially through drumming, fuels my creativity. 
                These activities help me maintain a balance between the mental challenges of academics and the physical or creative outlets I enjoy, 
                which boosts my overall performance in school.</p>

            <h3>My Hero: Marcus Garvey</h3>
            <img src="C:\Users\makon\OneDrive\Documents\23011101\assets\Did-you-Know-Marcus-Garvey-Created-the-Pan-African-Flag.jpeg" alt="Picture of Hero" class="img-marcusgarvey">
            <blockquote>
                "If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence, you have won even before you have started."
            </blockquote>
            <p>Marcus Garvey has always inspired me to embrace confidence and self-belief,
                qualities that I strive to uphold in my academic life and beyond. 
                His philosophy reminds me that believing in myself is essential to overcoming obstacles and achieving success, both in school and in life.</p>

            <p>I completed the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, and it classified me as a "Guardian." 
                I believe this is fairly accurate, as I tend to prioritize personal values and aim to contribute positively to the world around me. 
                However, like any personality test, it isn't flawless, and certain aspects didnâ€™t fully resonate with my personal experiences.</p>
